	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<blockquote>
		This is a site made by Evertras, an avid Heroes of the Storm fan!  This site is intended to help
		share tips and ideas in dealing with various heroes in the game quickly and anonymously with as little fuss as possible.
	</blockquote>

	<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
	<blockquote>
		Click a hero.  Add a tip.  Upvote good advice.  Downvote bad advice.  That's about it!  There's
		intentionally no login feature.  You can upvote or downvote a single tip only once.
	</blockquote>

	<h2>What happens after a big patch?</h2>
	<blockquote>
		Votes are stored along with what patch they were given under.  Once a new big patch comes out I'll be adding filters
		so you can see optionally filter out old patches.
